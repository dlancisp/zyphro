### STEP 2: The License (`LICENSE`) ⚖️

Your audit strongly recommends the **GNU GPL v3** license to build trust[cite: 1282].

1.  Create a file named **`LICENSE`** (no extension) in the root folder.
2.  Copy the full text of the GPL v3 license.
    * You can copy the text from here: [Official GPLv3 Text](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).

### STEP 3: Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`) 🛡️

This file tells the world (and companies) how to report bugs safely[cite: 1285].

Create a file named **`SECURITY.md`** in the root folder:

```markdown
# Security Policy
